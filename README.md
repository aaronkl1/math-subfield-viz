# math-subfield-viz
Visualizations of connections between subfields of math based on ArXiv data. For any two math subfields, we use the [arXiv API](https://info.arxiv.org/help/api/index.html) to find how many papers there are tagged in both categories. Our goal is to then use this data to visualize which subfields are most and least interconnected.
